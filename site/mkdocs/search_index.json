All those roles now have to be fulfilled by yourself.\n\n\n\n\nThe Controller\n\n\n\n\nA controller is generally in charge of the students\u2019\n\n\n\n\n actions\n\n\n motivations\n\n\n directions\n\n\n and of maintaining the students\u2019 attention.\n\n\n\n\nThe Coach\n\n\n\n\nThe role of the coach is meant to be\n\n\n\n\n an encourager\n\n\n a guider\n\n\n and a role model for students.\n\n\n\n\nThe Organizer\n\n\n\n\nThe role of the organizer includes setting up\n\n\n\n\n curriculum designs\n\n\n the activities\n\n\n and writing the lesson plan.\n\n\n\n\nThe Assessor\n\n\n\n\nAs an assessor a teacher gives feedback on\n\n\n\n\n quizzes\n\n\n tests\n\n\n assignments\n\n\n and projects.\n\n\n\n\nThe Knowledge-sharer\n\n\n\n\nThis is the role of the teacher where they are\n\n\n\n\n walking students through knowledge\n\n\n answering the questions\n\n\n and challenging the students to engage with the material.\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Purpose and major goals\n\n\nReflecting on your purpose\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nReflecting on your purpose of studying will help you to set overarching goals and to overcome smaller frustrations that might occur while studying online. \n\n\n\n\nHere are some helpful questions you can answer yourself to reflect on your purpose:\n\n\n\n\n Why did you sign up for Kiron?\n\n\n Why do you want to get a university degree?\n\n\n Or why are you interested in learning?\n\n\n What are your favorite subjects in school?\n\n\n If you had a career before what was it and what did you learn from it?\n\n\n What career would you like to have after school?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnchored learning\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAnchored learning is an instructional approach whereby teachers create stories or problems or contexts to fill in the learning experience. By relating the content to real-world problems or stories, the students\u2019 experienced is enriched and their learning is strengthened.\n\n\n\n\nTo help you getting into anchored learning follow those tips while learning ...\n\n\n\n\n try to situate yourself in the context of what you are learning.\n\n\n try to apply the conect to your future career.\n\n\n think about how to solve a real world problem with the context you learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth VS Fixed Mindset\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nNever let yourself limit by your fixed mindset which tells you that you can't change! Always think of your mindset as a growing part of yourself. This makes it much more easier to accept difficult challenges.\n\n\n\n\nA fixed mindset means thinking ...\n\n\n\n\nthat we can\u2019t change,\n\n\nthat our intelligence, success, and skills are already determined and are unable to change over time.\n\n\n\n\nA growth mindset is the opposite. It is someone ...\n\n\n\n\nwho says \"challenge accepted\",\n\n\nwho thrives off of overcoming these challenges,\n\n\nwho is not afraid to fail because failure means learning.\n\n\n\n\nThe following graphic summarizes the main differences between a fixed and a growth mindest.",
