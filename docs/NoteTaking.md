To gain an even deeper understanding of the concept, keep the following headwords in mind:

- ==Association== (previous things you learned)

- ==Application== (how to apply the concept in the real world)
- ==Food for thought== (what parts of the concept are inspiring, innovative or might raise an ethical dilemma)
