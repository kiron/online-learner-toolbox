!!! summary
	Never let yourself limit by your fixed mindset which tells you that you can't change! Always think of your mindset as a growing part of yourself. This makes it much more easier to accept difficult challenges.

A fixed mindset means thinking ...

* that we canâ€™t change,
* that our intelligence, success, and skills are already determined and are unable to change over time.

A growth mindset is the opposite. It is someone ...

* who says "challenge accepted",
* who thrives off of overcoming these challenges,
* who is not afraid to fail because failure means learning.

The following graphic summarizes the main differences between a fixed and a growth mindest.
