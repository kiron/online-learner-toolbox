!!! summary
	Chunking is a method of presenting information which splits concepts into small pieces or "chunks" of information to make reading and understanding faster and easier.

There are 3 main ways of chunking:

==Grouping:== You can organize any information into groups.

==Patterns:== You can organize information by finding patterns in the information. When you find a pattern in information you just need to remember the pattern.

==Organizing:== You can organize information based on its meaning. (e.g. You can organize people by their age, then, for each age group, remember the people that belong to that group.)


Advantages of chunking:

* [ ] It is easier for you to digest.
* [ ] It is easier to digest and remember smaller pieces of information
when you first learn about them.
* [ ] It is easier to form an organized hierarchical structure in your brain.
