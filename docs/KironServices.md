####Language Schools

Language is an essential part of your studies. On the one hand you will need a suitable level of language proficiency in English for studying at Kiron. On the other hand, you need to learn quickly the language of your host country for everyday life as well as for a future enrollment in a university.

To support you in achieving the necessary language skills, the Kiron Language School offers you access to a selection of online and offline courses from our partners.
