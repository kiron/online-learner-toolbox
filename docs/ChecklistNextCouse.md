###Checklist for preparing for your next course
 
* [ ] Read the syllabus and guidelines of the course you want to take.
* [ ] Look at homework, assignments or any other information you think will help you in your learning.
* [ ] Check the prerequisites for the course (prerequisites tell you what you need to know before you can take a course).

!!! tip
	If you don’t have a prerequisite, don’t worry. Just take the preparation courses or learn this information online through websites like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
