!!! summary
	The S.M.A.R.T goal mehtod helps ypu his method we are going to set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based.

Letter | Criterion |
------------ | ---------- |
S | Specific  |
M | Measurable  |
A | Attainable/Actionable  |
R | Relevant  |
T | Time-based/Time-bound  |


Below you find a definition of each of the S.M.A.R.T. goal criteria.

==Specific:== Goals should be simplistically written and clearly define what you are going to do.

==Measurable:== Goals should be measurable so that you have evidence that you have accomplished the
goal.

==Attainable/Actionable:== Goals should stretch you slightly so you feel challenged, but defined well enough so that you can achieve them.

==Relevant:== Goals should be relevant to the direction you want your life and career to take.

==Time-based/Time-bound:== Goals should be linked to a timeframe that creates a practical sense of urgency, or results in tension between the current reality and the vision of the goal.

!!! tip
	When defining your S.M.A.R.T goals use this questionnaire below to make sure that your goals are defined in a smart way.
	You can also rewatch [this video about the S.M.A.R.T goal method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-SvuFIQjK8), in case you want to refresh your knowledge about this method.

* [ ] ==Specific:== What will the goal accomplish? How and why will it be accomplished?

* [ ] ==Measurable:== How will you measure whether or not the goal has been reached (list at least two
indicators)?

* [ ] ==Achievable/Actionable:== Is it possible? Have others done it successfully? Will meeting the goal challenge you without defeating you?

* [ ] ==Relevant:== Why is this goal important to you? What are the benefits and rewards of accomplishing this goal? Why will you be able to stay committed in the long-run?

* [ ] ==Time-bound:== What is the established completion date and does that completion date create a practical
sense of urgency?
