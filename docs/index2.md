**b) Use discussion Websites** ask any question and discuss with online learners. :shit: 

* [Brainly](https://brainly.com/) educational questions and answers forum. Ask any question and get answers to any topic.
* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) the leading questions & answers website. Its users are very active, so you can ask anything and get answers quite quickly normally.
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) for some topics, you may try looking for external resources with more materials and discussions. For example, Khan Academy would have videos about almost anything in `math` and `sciences` and a discussion below each video where you can ask anything or see previous answers.
